# 2024-2025 Estimating Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Hard Drives in Streaming

Optional project of the [Streaming Data Analytics](https://emanueledellavalle.org/teaching/streaming-data-analytics-2024-25/) course provided by [Politecnico di Milano](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=837284&__pj0=0&__pj1=36cd41e96fcd065c47b49d18e46e3110).

Student: **[To be assigned]**

## **Background**  
Predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of hard drives is essential for proactive maintenance, reducing downtime, and preventing data loss. This project focuses on processing streaming sensor data to estimate when a hard drive is likely to fail.  

## **Goals and Objectives**  
- Develop a streaming pipeline to estimate hard drive RUL in real-time.  
- Compare different predictive models for estimating failure time.  
- Evaluate model performance using real or synthetic datasets.  

## **Datasets**  
The data is provided by the **DEBS Grand Challenge 2024** (details available [here](https://2024.debs.org/call-for-grand-challenge-solutions/)).  

## **Methodologies/Models to Apply**  
**Feature extraction and Incremental regression models** for continuous RUL estimation using **Streaming Machine Learning** algorithms from **River, MOA, or CapyMOA** .  


#### **Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** for RUL estimation accuracy.  
- **Latency** in making predictions under real-time conditions.  
- **Model adaptability** to sensor data drift over time.  

#### **Deliverable**  
A report detailing the methodology, implemented code, and an evaluation of model performance.
